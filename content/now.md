## Learning and fun

- Trying to break 1600 ELO in Chess.
- Valuation series by [Aswath Damodaran](https://www.youtube.com/@AswathDamodaranonValuation/playlists). Over 90% of my investments are in low-cost globally diversified market-cap weighted index funds, but I have been purchasing some individual stocks over the last few years as well.
- Lots and lots of reading. Mostly non-fiction, but some historical fiction too.

## Work

- Growing [Koko Analytics](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/).
- Maintaining and supporting [Mailchimp for WordPress](https://www.mc4wp.com/).


## Health

- Bouldering 2 times per week.
- General strength training once per week.
- Aerobic exercise (mostly cycling or running) 1-2 times per week.
