**Learning and fun**

- Working on [Nederlang](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/nederlang), another bytecode compiler and virtual machine (but using Rust this time).
- Going through MIT's OpenCourseWare videos on [Performance Engineering of Software Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/video_galleries/lecture-videos/). 
- Working my way through all of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)'s math courses for a much needed refresher.

**Work**

- Maintaining and supporting my [WordPress plugins](/wordpress-plugins/). Most of my time at work is spent on [Mailchimp for WordPress](https://www.mc4wp.com/) and [Koko Analytics](https://www.kokoanalytics.com).

**Health & Exercise**

- Training for Drenthe 200, a 200km gravel ride in December 2022.
- Training for Marathon Rotterdam in April 2023.
- Completed Limburgs Mooiste, a cycling event with a distance of 245km containing 3000m of elevation.
- Drove my bike from Koblenz to Nijmegen, totaling well over 450km and 5000m of elevation in just 4 days (carrying sleeping gear).
- Attempting to finally stave off (and hopefully fix) the sinus issues ("idiopathic rhinitis") I've been having for years now.  So far, so good. But winter is coming...
