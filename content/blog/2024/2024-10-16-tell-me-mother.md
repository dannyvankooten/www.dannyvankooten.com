Tell me mother				<br>
as you kiss your baby				<br>
that no one died today,				<br>
that no one was a martyr				<br>
or a hero,				<br>
and that all who now sleep will awake,				<br>
and that the sirens that now sound				<br>
will be the only death recorded,				<br>
and that the drivers without cars,				<br>
and the cars without drivers,				<br>
will each find a partner				<br>
for as long as they need,				<br>
like the Palm Doves in the park.

Tell me mother,<br>
that as long as you<br>
love your baby<br>
all mothers will love theirs<br>
and no mother will again mourn<br>
the foreheads without a kiss<br>
and the kiss that has no forehead<br>
to receive it.<br>

_This poem was originally written by Jayseth Guberman in 1990 on a bus in Herzliya for Holocaust Memorial Day. Though as the 20th Century bled into the 21st, it is clear that mothers and children all over our world are suffering untold miseries be they refugees escaping tyranny or victims of civil strife or war. This poem therefore is dedicated to all mothers and children._
