title = "One Billion Rows Challenge in C"
+++

Just a few days after finishing Advent of Code 2023, I got nerd sniped[^1] by [Gunnar Morling](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/) with his [One Billion Rows Challenge](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/).

The challenge is to compute simple floating-point math over 1 billion rows. As fast as possible, using only the Java standard library.

I conveniently ignored the Java constraint and did a [1BRC implementation in C](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/1brc) instead. It uses standard C99 with POSIX threads.

It's clocking in at just under 2 seconds on my AMD Ryzen 7 4800U laptop CPU. Which is 2x as fast as the fastest Rust implementation I've seen[^2] and 3x as fast as the current leading Java implementation[^3].

The numbers above assume a warm pagecache (as stated in the challenge rules). The performance difference between a warm and a hot cache is quite extreme:

```sh
$ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

$ time bin/analyze >/dev/null

real    0m5.048s
user    0m34.828s
sys     0m6.145s
```

And then, running again while the cache is warm:

```sh
$ time bin/analyze >/dev/null

real    0m1.949s
user    0m26.654s
sys     0m0.868s
```


## Largest performance improvements

- A huge part of the program's runtime is spent on reading the 12GB dataset file from disk. The kernel conveniently handles this for me by `mmap`'ing the file to a memory location. On consecutive runs, the file is usually still in pagecache.
- City names are hashed using FNV1-a with linear probing and a load factor of well under 0.5.
- Since our data has only one decimal, we can parse as an integer and perform integer math troughout our program.
- The data is processed in parallel using completely separate chunks. Once all threads are done, their results are in turn aggregated into the final result.


## Minor performance improvements

- Unrolling the parsing of the temperature so it accepts only one or two numbers before the separator. This means branching only once vs. twice or triple.
- Potentially branchless `min` and `max` functions:

```
int min(int a, int b) {
    return a ^ ((b ^ a) & -(b < a));
}
```

On certain machines, `b < a` requires a branch instruction though.

- Finding the position of the `;` separator while simultaneously hashing the city name, in the same loop.


## Potential improvements that did not work

- Not parsing the numbers but casting the last 8 bytes as an integer[^4] and only parsing the final result. A very interesting idea coined by Hello1024 in the GitHub discussions thread, but unfortunately not doable.
- Getting `MAP_HUGETLB` to work with a file mapping, because `MAP_HUGETLB` relies on `MAP_ANONYMOUS`, which if set will ignore the file descriptor parameter. Calling `mmap` once more or calling `read` to get the entire file into our mapped region proved slower than just letting the kernel deal with all the page faults.
