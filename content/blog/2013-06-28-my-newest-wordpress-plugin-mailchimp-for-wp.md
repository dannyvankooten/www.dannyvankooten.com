Around 2 years ago I started development of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter-sign-up/">Newsletter Sign-Up</a>, my most popular WordPress plugin which has been downloaded close to 150.000 times by now. 

A lot of people using this plugin were using it with Mailchimp which is why I decided to start development of a completely new plugin: <a title="Mailchimp plugin for WordPress" href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>.

This new plugin does everything Newsletter Sign-Up does and more and the code is of a higher standard. Because the plugin only supports Mailchimp I could build features specifically built for Mailchimp. I could also utilize their API which makes the plugin blazingly fast. Configuring the plugin got a lot easier, all you need is your API key and the plugin will fetch all your list data to ease configuring the rest of the settings.

I tried to make the plugin as flexible as possible. You can build your own form HTML mark-up but the plugin tries to give you a (big) hand by providing you with a field wizard. Also, almost <strong>all</strong> plugin settings are optional.

The plugin can be downloaded from the WordPress repository <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/Mailchimp-for-wp/">here</a>. Hope you like it, enjoy!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Update</em></span>: because of the enormous popularity of the plugin, I developed a <strong>premium version: </strong><a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress Pro</a>. It is simply awesome, over 3000 clients would say the same.
