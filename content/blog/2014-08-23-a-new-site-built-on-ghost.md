    <p>The below is vastly outdated. I've since moved to a static site generator called <s>Jekyll</s> <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>. <a href="https://github.com/dannyvankooten/www.dvk.co/">Source code is here on GitHub</a>. </p>

It was about time I spent some time to work on my personal site. 

The old one was vastly outdated in terms of content and technologies used. I also didn't write a single blog post in at least 6 months, while there is more than enough going on in my day to day life to write about.

Anyway, here it is: my new site. Pretty much everything in the way it is served has changed.

So far I am pretty pleased with the results. Working with Ghost and writing in Markdown has been a bless so far. Also, the new site speed is just incredible.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the new site and design - love it or hate it?

_PS. Maybe, just maybe, using Ghost will help me blog a little more often. I hope so._
