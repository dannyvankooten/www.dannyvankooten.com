The post also contains a bit of history about my journey building the various open-source and privacy-friendly analytics tools that I have been involved with over the last few years.

[Pricing for Koko Analytics Pro](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/pricing/) starts at â‚¬59 per year, with heavily discounted bulk packages available for if you have many websites.
