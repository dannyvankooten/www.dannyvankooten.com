It was about time I spent some time to work on my personal site. 

The old one was vastly outdated in terms of content and technologies used. I also didn't write a single blog post in at least 6 months, while there is more than enough going on in my day to day life to write about.

Anyway, here it is: my new site. Pretty much everything in the way it is served has changed.

<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
<table>
	<tr>
    	<th></th>
    	<th>Previously</th>
        <th>Now</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<th>Server software</th>
        <td>Apache</td>
        <td>Nginx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<th>Scripting language</th>
        <td>PHP 5.3</td>
        <td>Node</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<th>CMS</th>
        <td><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a></td>
        <td><a href="https://ghost.org/about/">Ghost</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<th>Theme</th>
        <td>Custom WordPress theme</td>
        <td>Modified version of <a href="https://github.com/daleanthony/uno">Uno</a>, a Ghost theme by <a href="https://www.daleanthony.com/">Dale Anthony</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
    	<th>Comments</th>
        <td>WordPress comments</td>
        <td><a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a></td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

So far I am pretty pleased with the results. Working with Ghost and writing in Markdown has been a bless so far. Also, the new site speed is just incredible.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the new site and design - love it or hate it?

_PS. Maybe, just maybe, using Ghost will help me blog a little more often. I hope so._
