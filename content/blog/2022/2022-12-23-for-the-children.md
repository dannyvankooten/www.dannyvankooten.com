The rising hills, the slopes, 			<br />
of statistics 			<br />
lie before us.			<br />
the steep climb 			<br />
of everything, going up, 			<br />
up, as we all 			<br />
go down.

In the next century 			<br />
or the one beyond that, 			<br />
they say, 			<br />
are valleys, pastures, 			<br />
we can meet there in peace 			<br />
if we make it. 

To climb these coming crests 			<br />
one word to you, to 			<br />
you and your children:

___stay together 			<br />
learn the flowers 			<br />
go light___
