	<p>Update (Mar 2019): I am <a href="/blog/2019/stepping-down-fathom-maintainer/">leaving Fathom Analytics</a>.</p>
	<p>Update (Mar 2020): The open-source version of Fathom has been discontinued after my departure. I've started <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a> as an open-source alternative for WordPress users.</p>

As I was browsing my Twitter feed a few weeks ago, I came across the following tweet by Paul Jarvis.

I had the same idea in late 2016 when I set out to build my own open-source website analytics alternative called [Ana](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/blob/db170276fb6081a8e4ca67594480dbd4fb290c06/README.md). It even got some traction back then and a handful of users are running it on their own servers already.

Sadly, I got sidetracked and didn't spend any more time on it during the last few months. I still firmly believe in the idea though.

Too many websites simply slam a Google Analytics tracking snippet in their footer and then barely look at it. There should be a simpler, faster and more private option available.

Knowing Paul as a super knowledgeable power-user of our [Mailchimp for WordPress plugin](https://www.mc4wp.com/), I replied to him that I would love to help out, if at all possible. And it was!

Together, we are setting out to build **website analytics that is simple, transparent and that respects your visitor's privacy**. We're a few weeks in at this point and already running a beta version of it on our personal sites:

We're developing Fathom Analytics out in the open; here's Fathom on GitHub. Expects lots of development happening over the next few weeks.

The plan is to create an open-source version that you can self-host on your own servers, free of charge. A hosted offering will be available if you want us to take care of running the software and keeping it online for you.
