Earlier today, our [Mailchimp for WordPress plugin crossed the 2 million downloads mark](https://www.mc4wp.com/blog/celebrating-2-million-downloads/) and we're super proud of that.

I remember [announcing the plugin](@/blog/2013/2013-06-28-my-newest-wordpress-plugin-mailchimp-for-wp.md) on my blog here and receiving only a handful of responses.

A year later, I wrote about reaching [the first big milestone: 100.000 downloads](@/blog/2013/2013-12-06-100-000-plugin-downloads-6-months-mailchimp-wordpress.md).

Then, barely 6 months ago we multiplied that number by 10. That makes [1 million total downloads](@/blog/2015/2015-02-15-one-million-downloads-mailchimp-wordpress.md). 

We doubled that number again today.

**2 million downloads**

To say I'm not super proud would make me a liar. 

When I started working on this plugin I was still enrolled in University.  In [the years that followed](@/blog/2014/2014-12-27-2014-year-in-review.md), I had an amazing time graduating at [Yoast](https://yoast.com/), [traveling](@/blog/2015/2015-03-13-interview-on-webworktravel.md) to various countries and [getting 2 wonderful people on board to help further grow my company](@/blog/2015/2015-06-19-introducing-ibericode.md).

If the next two years will only be half as good, I'll be a happy man. 

_Thank you!_
