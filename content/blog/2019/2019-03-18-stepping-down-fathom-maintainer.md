I have an announcement to make. Less than a year ago, Paul Jarvis and I [started working on Fathom](@/blog/2018/2018-05-12-reviving-ana-as-fathom.md) (simple and transparent website analytics). 

We managed to make a lot of progress during our first year and I'm more than a little proud of what Fathom is today. I'm running it on most of my sites and I'd say it's very much a viable alternative for Google Analytics for a lot of websites already.

The open-source community around Fathom is very much alive and kicking. The [GitHub repository for Fathom](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) currently boosts over 5.000 GitHub stars and Fathom has been a [trending Go project](https://github.com/trending/go) for pretty much every week over the last year! 

And the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/usefathom/fathom/) has been pulled over a million times, even though Fathom is already a single (embedded) binary that is super easy to deploy to your infrastructure of choice. There's even a [one-click installer if you're on DigitalOcean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE0NKODYEAM).

The software we built itself proved very effective in terms of performance. A single $5 VPS can easily handle tens of millions of pageviews per month, as proved by some of the bigger customers on Fathom's PRO plans. 

### Stepping down

To think that Fathom would be so well received and grow so rapidly during its first year is amazing and I'm super proud to have been a part of that. 

Have been, because going forward, I will not be actively involved with Fathom anymore. **Fathom itself is not going anywhere though.** Paul is now joined by [Jack Ellis](https://twitter.com/JackEllis) with whom he will be continuing the project. Having seen them work together during the handover phase, I completely trust in their abilities to keep making Fathom better.

I am a little sad to leave Fathom behind but juggling its responsibilities with being a newbie dad and running [Mailchimp for WordPress](https://www.mc4wp.com/) while also wanting to spend less time behind a computer proved way harder than anticipated. 

At the same time, I'm stoked to see [their plans](https://trello.com/b/x2aBwH2J/fathom-roadmap) unfold over the next few months. I'm confident they will take good care of what we managed to build over the past year.
