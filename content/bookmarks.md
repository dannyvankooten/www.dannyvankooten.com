A collection of links on the WWW which I use, admire or agree with.

## Software

I've been happily running Linux on my laptop (which is my workstation) since 2016 [^1].

Made possible by the following list of mostly open-source software (not exhaustive).

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/): the Linux distribution I use as my daily driver.
- [Sway](https://swaywm.org/): tiling window manager.
- [Foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot): Wayland terminal emulator.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/): web browser.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), text editor.
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/): ad-blocker.
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): password manager.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/): sh compatibe shell.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com): proprietary to-do list that basically runs my life.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): image editor.
- [Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution): Gnome email client that does [plain-text email](https://useplaintext.email/) correctly.


## Web development

- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/): web server software.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): SQL database servers.
- [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): HTML, CSS and JS documentation.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/): content management system. Sadly, most themes are bloated.
- [A11Y accessibility checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
- [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/)
- [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/): git hosting service.
- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/): PHP web framework.
- [Gozer](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/gozer): Static site generator, turns Markdown files into HTML pages.

On the frontend, I strive to not use any CSS frameworks and only use JavaScript sparingly. I have also been intrigued by [#NoBuild](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c) lately, although a build step for [concatenating and compressing files](https://csswizardry.com/2023/10/the-three-c-concatenate-compress-cache/) with a similar lifespan is probably worth it for performance reasons.
