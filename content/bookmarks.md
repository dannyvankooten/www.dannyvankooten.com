## Software

I've been happily running Linux on my laptop since 2016.

Made possible by the following list of mostly open-source software (not exhaustive).

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), the Linux distribution I use as my daily driver.
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/), desktop environment.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), web browser.
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), ad-blocker.
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), password manager.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), sh compatibe shell. I like Fish too, but it's just too convenient to find Bash pre-installed pretty much anywhere.
- [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), image manipulation.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com), to-do app that runs my life (proprietary).
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), image editor.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), SVG editor.


## Web development

- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), web server software.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). SQL database servers.
- [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), all the HTML, CSS and JS documentation you need.
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), IDE (proprietary).
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), content management system. Sadly, most themes are bloated.
- [A11Y accessibility checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
- [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/)
- [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/), git hosting service.
- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), PHP and Python web frameworks.
- [Gozer](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/gozer) Static site generator, turns Markdown files into HTML pages.

I strive to not use any CSS frameworks and only use JavaScript sparingly. Have also been intrigued by [#NoBuild](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c) lately.
