## Software

I've been happily running Linux on my laptop since 2016. It realy just works nowadays (yes, even printers!). 

Made possible by the following list of open-source software (not exhaustive).

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), a Linux distribution.
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/), Linux desktop environment.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), web browser.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), sh compatibe shell. I like Fish too, but it's just so damn convenient to find Bash pre-installed pretty much anywhere.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com), to-do app that runs my life (proprietary).
- [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), image manipulation.


## Web development

- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), PHP web framework.
- [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/), ORM and Database Abstraction Layer for PHP.
- [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), static site generator (in Rust, so compiles to a single binary). 
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), alternative static site generator with lots of plugins. Requires Ruby though.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), content management system. Sadle, most themes are bloated.
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), web server software.
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), IDE, wouldn't want to write PHP without it.
