## Software

I've been happily running Linux on my laptop since 2016. Made possible by the following open-source software (although the list is not exhaustive).

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), a Linux distribution.
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) Desktop environment.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com) To-do app that runs my life.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) Web browser.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) sh compatibe shell. I like Fish too, but it's just so damn convenient to find Bash pre-installed pretty much anywhere.
- [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), image manipulation.


## Web development 

- [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), all the documentation you need.
- [A11Y accessibility checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
- [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/)
- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), PHP web framework.
- [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/) Object Relational Mapper and Database Abstraction Layer for PHP.
- [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), static site generator. 
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), another really good static site generator. Only downside for me is that it is Ruby based.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), content management system. Most themes suck, sadly.
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), web server software.
- Minifiers: [HTML](https://terser.org/html-minifier-terser/), [JS](https://terser.org/), [CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/)
