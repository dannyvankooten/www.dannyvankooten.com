Hi, my name is Danny van Kooten.

Here are the most important things you may want to know about me.

I..

- .. am the father of two young kids and a doggo.
- .. am a programmer and accidental entrepeneur from The Netherlands.
- .. am the founder of <a href="http://ibericode.com/">ibericode</a>, a small and fully remote company selling open-source software.
- .. build and maintain <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.htmlformsplugin.com">HTML Forms</a>, <a href="https://boxzillaplugin.com/">Boxzilla</a> and several other <a href="/wordpress-plugins/">WordPress plugins</a> totaling <strong>well over 40 million</strong> downloads. Right now, my code is running on more than 2 million different websites.
- .. strongly believe in the importance of open-source software. Most of [my work](/projects) is either MIT or GPL licensed and <a href="https://github.com/dannyvankooten/">available on GitHub</a>.
- .. <a href="/now">am doing this right now</a>

I hope that sums it up quite well and that you enjoy my work in some way.

### Life outside of work

On a more personal note, I also love to sail small dinghies, ride my bike, walk around in nature and climb rocks to counter all this time spent behind a computer.
