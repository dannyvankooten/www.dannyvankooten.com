<p>Here are the most important things you may want to know about me.</p>

<h3>I..</h3>

<ul>
    <li>.. am the father of two young kids and a doggo.</li>
    <li>.. am a programmer from The Netherlands.</li>
    <li>.. am the founder of <a href="http://ibericode.com/">ibericode</a>, a small and fully remote company selling open-source software.</li>
    <li>.. build and maintain <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.htmlformsplugin.com">HTML Forms</a>, <a href="https://boxzillaplugin.com/">Boxzilla</a> and several other <a href="/wordpress-plugins/">WordPress plugins</a> totaling <strong>well over 30 million</strong> downloads. Right now, my code is running on more than 2 million different websites.</li>
