Hi, my name is Danny van Kooten.

Here are the most important things you may want to know about me.

I..

- .. am the father of two girls and a doggo (named Koko).
- .. am a programmer and accidental entrepeneur from The Netherlands.
- .. am the founder of <a href="http://ibericode.com/">ibericode</a>, a small and fully remote company building and marketing open-source software.
- .. build and maintain <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.htmlformsplugin.com">HTML Forms</a> and several other [WordPress plugins](/wordpress-plugins/) totaling <strong>well over 42 million</strong> downloads. Right now, my code is running on more than 2 million websites.
- .. strongly believe in the importance of open-source software. Most of [what I build](/code/) is MIT or GPL licensed and available on either <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~dvko/">sourcehut</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dannyvankooten/">GitHub</a>.
- .. [am doing this right now](/now/)
- .. [am using or liking this these days](/bookmarks/)

I hope that sums it up quite well and that you enjoy my work in some way.

### Life outside of work

On a more personal note, I also love to sail small dinghies, ride my bike, eat Indian curries or homemade pizza, walk around in nature and climb rocks to counter all this time spent behind a computer.
