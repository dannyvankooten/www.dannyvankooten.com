Hello! I'm Danny van Kooten, a programmer from The Netherlands.

I've been building, maintaining and delivering support for open-source software as my main source of income for well over a decade now.

It started out in the summer of 2013 with me hospitalized in Vietnam due to acute appendicitis and having some time to kill while practicing bed rest.
That time was used to build <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">MC4WP</a>, a WordPress plugin now in active use on well over 2 million websites.

[More software](/projects/) followed while I spent several Dutch winters in Asia. In 2016, I settled down again in the Netherlands together with my wife and 2 kids.

## Some things about me

Here are the most important things you may want to know about me. I..

- .. am the founder of <a href="http://ibericode.com/">ibericode</a>, a small and fully remote company developing, maintaining and marketing open-source software products.
- .. build and maintain <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.htmlformsplugin.com">HTML Forms</a> and several other [WordPress plugins](/wordpress-plugins/) totaling <strong>well over 54 million</strong> downloads. Right now, my code is running on more than 2 million websites.
- .. strongly believe in open-source software. Most of [what I build](/code/) is MIT or GPL licensed and available on either <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~dvko/">sourcehut</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dannyvankooten/">GitHub</a>.
- .. [am doing this right now](/now/)
- .. [am using or liking this these days](/bookmarks/)

I hope that sums it up quite well and that you enjoy my work in some way.

### Life outside of work

On a more personal note, I also love to walk my dog, sail small dinghies, ride my bike, eat Indian curries or homemade pizza, walk around in nature and climb rocks to counter all this time spent behind a computer.
