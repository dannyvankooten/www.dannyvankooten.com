My name is Danny and I'm a programmer from Nijmegen, a small city in The
Netherlands that's close to the border with Germany.

I've been building, maintaining and delivering support for open-source software as my main source of income for well over a decade now.

It started out in the summer of 2013 with me hospitalized in Vietnam due to acute appendicitis and having some time to kill while practicing bed rest.
That time was used to build <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">MC4WP</a>, a WordPress plugin now in active use on well over 2 million websites.

[More software](/projects/) followed while I spent several Dutch winters in Asia. In 2016, I settled down again in the Netherlands together with my wife and 2 kids.
