My name is Danny and I'm a programmer from Nijmegen, a relatively small city in The Netherlands that's hugging the border with Germany.

I've been building, maintaining and delivering support for open-source software products as my main source of income for well over a decade now.

It all started out with me hospitalized in Vietnam due to acute appendicitis and thus having some time to kill. That time was used to build <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, a plugin now in active use on well over 2 million websites.

[More software](/projects/) followed while I tried to avoid Dutch winters by staying in Asia. As of 2016, I am back in The Netherlands together with my wife and 2 kids.
