Hi, you've reached Danny's personal corner of the internet.

I've been selling open-source software as my main and only source of income for well over 10 years now. According to some, I've never had a "real" job. But I know that my work is as real as it gets.

It all started out with me hospitalized in Vietnam due to acute appendicitis and thus having some time on my hands. I used that time to build <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, a plugin now in active use on well over 2 million websites out there.

Some [more software](@/projects.md) products followed while I worked from Asia over the next few years. Nowadays, I am usually working from home in The Netherlands while trying to be a good father for my 2 daughters.

Still here? See what I'm working on [now](@/now.md), some [projects](@/projects.md) I've done or a more general list of [code](@/code.md) I put out there.
