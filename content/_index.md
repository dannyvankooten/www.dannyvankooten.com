Hello,

I'm Danny - a full stack web developer from The Netherlands.

I've been building, maintaining and marketing open-source software products as my main source of income for well over a decade now. According to some, I've never had a "real" job. But my work is as real as it gets.

It all started out with me hospitalized due to acute appendicitis and thus having some time to kill. That time was used to build <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, a plugin now in active use on well over 2 million websites out there.

Some [more software](/projects/) products followed while I avoided the Dutch winters by staying in Asia. Nowadays, I am back in The Netherlands together with my wife and 2 kids.

See what I'm working on [now](/now/), some [projects](/projects/) I've done, my [favorite bookmarks](/bookmarks/) or a more general list of [code](/public/code/) I've been involved with.

## Hire me

I love solving problems. Give me your problem and I'll make it mine until it's no longer a problem.

In all seriousness, I am very comfortable dealing with Golang, JavaScript and SQL, a quick learner and currently open for small projects, preferably performance related.

If you have something in your stack that you would like to run faster, [hire me](/hire-me/) and I'll make it happen.
