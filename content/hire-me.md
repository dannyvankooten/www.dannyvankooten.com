title = "Hire me"
+++

Over the last 10 years I've been building projects for the web using a wide array of technologies:

- Backend: Golang, PHP, JavaScript, Python, Rust and C.
- Frontend: JavaScript (Vanilla, (P)Rreact), HTML, CSS.
- Databases: OLTP (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite) but also OLAP databases like Clickhouse, Polars or DuckDB.

Because of this I have a solid overview of what is out there and how certain things work under the hood.
A lot of things come down to simply using the right tool for the job.

If you have something in your web project that you would like to run faster, you can hire me to make that happen.

Email to [hi@dvk.co](mailto:hi@dvk.co) with a short description of your project, we will take it from there.
