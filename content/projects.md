#### Fathom Analytics

Open-source and privacy friendly analytics. The project is still going strong and has turned into a flourishing business, but I [stepped away from it](/blog/2019/stepping-down-fathom-maintainer/) in 2019 as its success at the time was hard to combine with 2 young children.

#### Browserpass

A browser extension for [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), the unix password manager. I started hacking on this as I wanted to give [native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) a try, which was pretty new at the time.

#### ibericode/vat

A PHP library for dealing with European VAT rules.

#### Mailchimp for WordPress

A WordPress plugin that adds various sign-up methods to ones WordPress website. I built the first version of this from [a hospital bed in Vietnam](/blog/2013/100-000-plugin-downloads-6-months-mailchimp-wordpress/) and it immediately turned into a rollercoaster of events.

At the time of writing (2022) it has been downloaded well over 52 million times and is in active use on over 2 million websites.
