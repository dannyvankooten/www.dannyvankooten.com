A non-exhaustive list of some projects that I worked on over the years.

#### Mailchimp for WordPress

A WordPress plugin that allows you to tightly integrate your site with your Mailchimp account.

The plugin grew to well over 100.000 active users in its first year, after which I built a paid version from [a hospital bed in Vietnam](/blog/2013/100-000-plugin-downloads-6-months-mailchimp-wordpress/) which turned into a huge success.

At the time of writing (2022) it has been downloaded well over 52 million times and is in active use on over 2 million websites.

#### HTML Forms

A WordPress plugin to create multipurpose forms and handle form submissions in a safe and extendible way.

I grew this plugin to a healthy ~9.000 active users before selling it in early 2024.

#### Fathom Analytics

Open-source and privacy friendly analytics. I [stepped away from Fathom](/blog/2019/stepping-down-fathom-maintainer/) in 2019 as its success at the time was hard to combine with 2 young children, but the project is still going strong (although no longer open-source) and has turned into a flourishing business.

#### Browserpass

A browser extension for [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), the unix password manager. I started hacking on this as I wanted to give [native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) a try, which was pretty new at the time.
