<p class="intro">A long requested feature has just made its way into MailChimp for WordPress Pro: <strong>the ability to create multiple form themes using the Styles Builder</strong>. It's one of those features of which I wonder why I didn't include it in the plugin to begin with.</p>

### Styling individual sign-up forms

Up until now, using the Styles Builder would generate a stylesheet which would affect all of your sign-up forms. This made it a little hard to target individual forms, your only option was to add custom CSS rules to the Manual CSS section.

After updating the [MailChimp for WordPress plugin](https://mc4wp.com/) to version 2.4 the Styles Builder will ask you for which form you want to design styles.

Selecting a form will load any previous form styles you may have created for this form. When saving your styles the plugin will generate a stylesheet only targeting the selected form. This gives us the awesome ability to have multiple forms with complete different styles.

The best part: __all this without writing a single line of CSS__.

For those of you still on the [free version of the plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/); what are you waiting for? Now would be a great time to [upgrade to MailChimp for WordPress Pro](https://mc4wp.com/).
