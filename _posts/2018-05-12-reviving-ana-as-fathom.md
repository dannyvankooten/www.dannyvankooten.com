As I was browsing my Twitter feed a few weeks ago, I came across the following tweet.

[![Paul's tweet about Fathom](/media/2018/paul-fathom-tweet.jpg)](https://twitter.com/pjrvs/status/985874315563286528)

I had the same idea in late 2016 when I set out to built my own open-source website analytics alternative called Ana. It even got some traction back then. 

Sadly, I got sidetracked and didn't spend any more time on it. I still firmly believe in the idea though.

Knowing Paul as a super knowledgeable power-user of our [Mailchimp for WordPress plugin](https://www.mc4wp.com/), I tweeted him that I would love to help out, if at all possible. And it was! 

Together, we are setting out to build **website analytics that is simple, transparent and that respects your visitor's privacy**. We're a few weeks in at this point and already running a beta version on our personal sites:

We're developing Fathom out in the open; here's [Fathom on GitHub](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom).
