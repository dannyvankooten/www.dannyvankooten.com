<h1>Personal goals for 2020</h1>

<p class="muted">Published <time datetime="2019-12-31">2019-12-31</time> on <a href="https://www.dannyvankooten.com/blog/2019/goals-for-2020/">Permalink</a></p>


<p>My last blog post where I defined <a href="@/blog/2013/2013-01-02-goals-for-2013.md">goals for the upcoming year was back in 2013</a>.</p>
<p>It's fun to go through that post. In a way I feel some shame of where I was back then (which is silly, but I feel it nonetheless). At the same time it's a testament of how far I've come, so there is some proud as well.</p>
<p>Since this will be another post in which I will be defining my goals for the upcoming year, I hope to be looking at this post a few years from now with the same mix of feelings.</p>
<p>For the last few years I have been drifting, just taking life as it happened. Caring for my daughter (now daughters!), keeping <a href="https://ibericode.com/">the business</a> running, trying to stay healthy while attempting to enjoy life at the same time.</p>
<p>But I miss having clear and measurable goals. I like the feeling of moving closer to a set target each and every day, even if just a tiny bit. That's why I came up with this list of what I would like to achieve in 2020.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Hire a WordPress developer</h3>
<p>I've postponed this for years, only hiring to help reduce the burden of daily support.</p>
<p>Despite it being justified financially to bring on another WordPress developer to help me out with more advanced support questions and possibly some development, I've yet to take the plunge.</p>
<p>For 7 straight years I have been answering emails for the <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress plugin</a> each and every day, with at most 48 hours of rest in between. This has certainly taken its toll, so I would like to get some help in this area or alternatively sell off the product in its entirety.</p>
<h3>Learn Rust</h3>
<p>After learning Go (and open-sourcing <a href="@/blog/2016/2016-11-06-chrome-extension-for-pass.md">Browserpass</a>) in 2016 and some C in 2019, I would like to gain a basic understanding of Rust in 2020.</p>
<p>This goal is a little vague as it is, so I will need to rephrase this goal by setting out to create a specific tool in Rust instead. More on that later.</p>
<h3>Lead climb in nature</h3>
<p>In the spring of 2020 I will be taking lessons in lead climbing. The plan is to use our summer holiday to go lead climbing in nature. Slovenia is tempting, but I am not sure whether we are ready to make the 12-hour drive with 2 young kids aboard.</p>
<p>There are so many spots in Europe to go lead climbing that finding a beautiful place closer to home shouldn't be an issue though.</p>
<p><img src="/media/2019/slovenia-climbing.jpg" alt="Climbing in Bled, Slovenia"></p>
<h3>Send a bouldering route graded 6C (V6)</h3>
<p>Another climbing related goal is to send an indoor bouldering route graded 6C. After just a few months of climbing I'm currently climbing 6B on a good day, so this should not be an issue if I put in consistent sessions and do not injure myself.</p>
<h3>Get my chess ELO rating up to 1600</h3>
<p>I have been slacking when it comes to chess lately, not playing any games at all for months. Perhaps having a clear goal will help.</p>
<p>My current ELO rating is about 1400, I would like to get this up to 1600 in 2020.</p>
<h3>Not buying a new laptop</h3>
<p>My current laptop is a 2013 Macbook Pro, which is still running great. Despite that I have been feeling the urge to replace it lately, even though <a href="@/blog/2017/2017-01-15-2016-year-in-review.md#switched-back-to-linux">it is not even my daily driver</a>.</p>
<p>I gave in to the urge last month and bought a Dell XPS 15&quot;, only to return it a week later because I realised it was an unnecessary purchase. So for 2020 (and beyond) the goal is to hold on to the Macbook Pro until it literally falls apart.</p>

<p>If you're still reading this far (and even if not), here's to a wonderful 2020 for you and your loved ones.</p>
