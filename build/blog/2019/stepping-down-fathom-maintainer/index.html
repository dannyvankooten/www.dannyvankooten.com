<h1>Stepping down from Fathom</h1>
    <p>I have an announcement to make. Less than a year ago, Paul Jarvis and I <a href="@/blog/2018/2018-05-12-reviving-ana-as-fathom.md">started working on Fathom</a> (simple and transparent website analytics).</p>
<p>We managed to make a lot of progress during our first year and I'm more than a little proud of what Fathom is today. I'm running it on most of my sites and I'd say it's very much a viable alternative for Google Analytics for a lot of websites already.</p>
<p><img src="/media/2019/fathom-screenshot.png" alt="Fathom screenshot"></p>
<p>The open-source community around Fathom is very much alive and kicking. The <a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom">GitHub repository for Fathom</a> currently boosts over 5.000 GitHub stars and Fathom has been a <a href="https://github.com/trending/go">trending Go project</a> for pretty much every week over the last year!</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/usefathom/fathom/">Docker image</a> has been pulled over a million times, even though Fathom is already a single (embedded) binary that is super easy to deploy to your infrastructure of choice. There's even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE0NKODYEAM">one-click installer if you're on DigitalOcean</a>.</p>
<p>The software we built itself proved very effective in terms of performance. A single $5 VPS can easily handle tens of millions of pageviews per month, as proved by some of the bigger customers on Fathom's PRO plans.</p>
<h3>Stepping down</h3>
<p>To think that Fathom would be so well received and grow so rapidly during its first year is amazing and I'm super proud to have been a part of that.</p>
<p>Have been, because going forward, I will not be actively involved with Fathom anymore. <strong>Fathom itself is not going anywhere though.</strong> Paul is now joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/JackEllis">Jack Ellis</a> with whom he will be continuing the project. Having seen them work together during the handover phase, I completely trust in their abilities to keep making Fathom better.</p>
<p>I am a little sad to leave Fathom behind but juggling its responsibilities with being a newbie dad and running <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a> while also wanting to spend less time behind a computer proved way harder than anticipated.</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm stoked to see <a href="https://trello.com/b/x2aBwH2J/fathom-roadmap">their plans</a> unfold over the next few months. I'm confident they will take good care of what we managed to build over the past year.</p>
