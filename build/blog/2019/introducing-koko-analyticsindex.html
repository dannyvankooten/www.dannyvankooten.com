        <p>After <a href="@/blog/2019/2019-03-18-stepping-down-fathom-maintainer.md">stepping down from Fathom</a> earlier this year, I was happy working on <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a> for a good few months
before realising that I was still thinking about how to make web analytics more private.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that part of why I was building Fathom in Go was because I wanted a break from WordPress and because I deemed it necessary to achieve good enough performance.</p>
<p>That last part might still hold true, but when choosing not to keep track of bounce rates and the time a visitor spends on a page, things become much simpler.</p>
<p>Add to that the following facts and an idea was born:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a third-party service to your site to keep track of your visitors will never be as private as a self-hosted service.</li>
<li>The majority of WordPress users will never self-host their analytics if it's not as easy as installing and activating a plugin.</li>
<li><a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all">WordPress powers 34.9% of the internet</a>. That's 34.9% of the internet owning their data, despite usually not being a developer themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why I set out to built <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a>, a privacy-friendly analytics plugin for WordPress that does not use any external services.</p>
<p><img src="/media/2019/koko-analytics-dashboard.png" alt="Koko Analytics dashboard"></p>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<p>Koko Analytics currently keeps track of the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total site visitors</li>
<li>Total site pageviews</li>
<li>(Unique) pageviews for posts, pages, products, etc.</li>
<li>Referrers (including a built-in blacklist to filter referrer spam)</li>
</ul>
<p>The nice thing about running inside of WordPress is that it gives the software first-hand knowledge about what's being tracked and allows it to offer seamless integrations, like built-in event tracking for leaving comments or any of the popular form plugins.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Most likely, you won't even notice that Koko Analytics is there. Even when your site is getting hammered by a sudden burst of traffic.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the plugin uses an append-only buffer file in which pageviews are temporarily stored until they are aggregated using a background process that runs every 60 seconds.</p>
<p>In my tests it was able to handle well over 15.000 requests per second, meaning you don't have to worry about being on the first page of Hacker News. <a href="@/blog/2019/2019-02-04-from-go-back-to-php-again.md">PHP has really come a long way</a> in the last few years.</p>
<h3>Downloading the plugin</h3>
<p>To make sure as many people as possible have access to Koko Analytics and any improvements made by me or others, the plugin is GPLv3 licensed and available for free download.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/koko-analytics">download Koko Analytics from WordPress.org</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ibericode/koko-analytics">contribute to it on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you're running Koko Analytics on your WordPress site then please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact/">let me know</a> and share your thoughts on how we can make it better.</p>
<p>And definitely consider <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/koko-analytics/reviews/#new-post">leaving a plugin review on WordPress.org</a>, because as you can see we desperately need some.</p>
