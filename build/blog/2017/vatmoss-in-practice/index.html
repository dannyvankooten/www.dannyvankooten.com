        <p>If you're selling a product or service online, you probably know how much harder accepting payments from Europan consumers got since the new 2015 VATMOSS rulings.</p>
<p>You now have several VAT rates to keep track of and apply and taking care of the required location evidence can be a real pain (try selling to someone who's traveling).</p>
<h2>Blocking EU countries</h2>
<p>When asked how to handle VATMOSS, I usually advise to ignore it until at a later stage. I wouldn't delay a product launch when it is far easier to simply block out European private consumers for the time being. It's sad, but it's true.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is also a feature that shop platforms have been offering for some time now. SendOwl, a company that helps you accept payments for your digital products, tweeted this earlier today:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sendowl.com/blog/fraud-filtering-now-available.html"><img src="/media/sendowl-vatmoss-tweet.jpg" alt="SendOwl's tweet on their new country-blocking feature"></a></p>
<p>The blog post they link to is from late 2014, so they have been offering this feature right from the start of VATMOSS.</p>
<h2>Missed out revenue from EU customers</h2>
<p>Curous what blocking European customers (not businesses) entirely would actually mean in terms of revenue for our products, I pulled up the following data for <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>. It is taken from sales data for the last 2 years, since the ruling came into effect.</p>
<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>%</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>EU Consumer</td><td>18.5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EU Business</td><td>13.0%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Non-EU</td><td>68.5%</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>About 18.5% of our revenue came from people (not businesses) living in one of the EU member states¹. Of that number, an average of 20% is collected taxes that we had to pay out to each member state using a rather cumbersome process.</p>
<p>With profit margins as high as 90% in the software industry, it's not hard to imagine this being a viable option for businesses that do not yet have the resources available to properly handle VATMOSS.</p>
<p>This is the sad result of VATMOSS in practice. Hurting where it shouldn't.</p>
<hr>
<p>¹ <em>Since the <a href="https://ibericode.com/">ibericode</a> business is located in The Netherlands, the actual missed out revenue would be about 2-3% lower. Blocking EU countries becomes more viable when your business itself is located in one of the larger member states.</em></p>
