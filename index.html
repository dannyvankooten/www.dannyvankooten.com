    <p>Hi. I'm Danny, a nerd in his early thirties.</p>
    <p>I've been selling software as my main and only source of income for well over 10 years now. According to some, I've never had a "real" job. But I know that my work is as real as it gets.</p>
    <p>It all started out with me being hospitalized in Vietnam due to acute appendicitis and thus having some computer time. I used that time to build <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, which is now in active use on well over 2 million websites out there.</p>
    <p>Some more software products followed while I worked from Asia for the next few years. Nowadays, I am usually working from home in The Netherlands while trying to be a father for my 2 daughters.</p>
    <p>You can read <a href="/now">what I'm currently working on or excited about</a> here.</p>
