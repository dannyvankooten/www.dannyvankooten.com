            <p>I've been selling software as my main and only source of income for a little over 8 years now. Basically, I've never had a real job.</p>
            <p>It started out with me being hospitalized in Vietnam and thus having some computer time. I used that time to build <a href="https://mc4wp.com/">MailChimp for WordPress</a>, which is now in use on well over 1 million websites.</p>
            <p>A few other products followed while I worked from warmer parts of the world for a few years. These days, I am settling down in The Netherlands. <a href="/now">Go here to see what I'm working on right now.</a></p>
