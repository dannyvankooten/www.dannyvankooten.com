<p>Hi, my name is Danny van Kooten.</p>

<p>Here are the most important things you may want to know about me.</p>

<h3>I..</h3>

<ul>
    <li>.. am a self-employed developer from The Netherlands.</li>
    <li>.. am the founder of <a href="http://ibericode.com/">ibericode</a>, a small and fully remote company selling open-source software.</li>
    <li>.. build and maintain <a href="https://www.mc4wp.com/">Mailchimp for WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.kokoanalytics.com/">Koko Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.htmlforms.io">HTML Forms</a>, <a href="https://boxzillaplugin.com/">Boxzilla</a> and several other <a href="{{site.url}}/wordpress-plugins/">WordPress plugins</a> totaling <strong>well over 30 million</strong> downloads. Right now, my code is running on more than 2 million different websites.</li>
    <li>.. strongly believe in open-source software. Most of my work is either MIT or GPL licensed and <a href="https://github.com/dannyvankooten/">available on GitHub</a>.</li>
    <li>.. was interviewed by <a href="http://www.webworktravel.com/interview-with-danny-van-kooten/">WebWorkTravel</a> and <a href="https://nomadlist.com/stories/slow-travel">NomadList</a> on my (previous) lifestyle combining travel &amp; work.</li>
    <li>.. <a href="/now">am doing this right now</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That sums it up quite well, I think. :) I hope that you enjoy my work! </p>
