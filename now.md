**Work**

- Maintaining and support my [WordPress plugins](/wordpress-plugins/). Most of my time is spent on [Mailchimp for WordPress](https://www.mc4wp.com/) and [Koko Analytics](https://www.kokoanalytics.com).

**Education**

- Working my way through all of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)'s math courses for a much needed refresher.
- Attending school again in September 2022 to get pre-university certificates for Math, Physics, Dutch and English.

**Environment**

- Learning about [food forests](https://edepot.wur.nl/448781) and scouting for land to start one myself.
- Having fun in our home garden, which is just 200 square meters but full of life nonetheless.

**Health & Exercise**

- Training for Limburgs Mooiste, a cycling event with a distance of 245km containing 3000m of elevation.
- Attempting to finally stave off (and hopefully fix) the sinus issues ("idiopathic rhinitis") I've been having for years now.
