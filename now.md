**Work**

- Maintaining and support my [WordPress plugins](/wordpress-plugins/). Most of my time is spent on [Mailchimp for WordPress](https://www.mc4wp.com/) and [Koko Analytics](https://www.kokoanalytics.com).

**Education**

- Working my way through all of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)'s math courses for a much needed refresher.
- Attending school again in September 2022 to get pre-university certificates for Math, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Dutch and English.

**Environment**

- Learning about [food forests](https://edepot.wur.nl/448781) and scouting for land to start one myself.
- Lowering the overall footprint of my family through a combination of diet, as few (electric) car movements as possible (❤️ cycling) and lowering energy requirements for our house.

**Health & Exercise**

- Completed Limburgs Mooiste, a cycling event with a distance of 245km containing 3000m of elevation.
- Drove my bike from Koblenz to my home in Nijmegen, totaling well over 450km and 5000m of elevation.
- Working towards a 4W/kg FTP, currently at 3.25.
- Attempting to finally stave off (and hopefully fix) the sinus issues ("idiopathic rhinitis") I've been having for years now.
